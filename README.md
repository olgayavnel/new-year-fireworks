😺 Aww, let’s start by setting up the project and the structure. But before that, a quick recap.

💡  What is Canvas API? If you have never worked with it before, no worries! It is fairly simple and so much fun!

The Canvas API offers developers a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript and the HTML element. Among other things, it can be used for animation, game graphics, data visualisation, photo manipulation, and real-time video processing. Wow! With this tool in hands, we can create mind-blowing 2D graphics.

Jump into your favourite code editor (VS Code is my personal choice), and search for the live server extension. Install it and relaunch the editor. You should see “Go Live” option in the bottom right corner of your editor.
